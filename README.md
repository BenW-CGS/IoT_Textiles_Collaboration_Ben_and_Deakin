# IoT_Textiles_Collaboration_Ben_and_Deakin

Code for the Textiles Collaboration assignment, where we create a hoodie with IoT. We still don't know who out other partner is, however we have a general idea. We will take our last assignment and change it so that it can play a song on the speakers. We can do this by making it so that we can click something and call a function to play a song. This is the first step.
